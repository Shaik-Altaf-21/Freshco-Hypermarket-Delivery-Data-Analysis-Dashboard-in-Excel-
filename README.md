# MS Excel Capstone Project

**Objective:**

To evaluate delivery performance and customer behavior patterns using Excel-based analytics, identify operational bottlenecks, and recommend data-driven strategies to improve service efficiency, reliability, and customer satisfaction.

**Description:**

Analyzed 50,000+ rows of transactional and customer data to assess delivery performance and identify key factors influencing service efficiency.

Conducted order, completion, and delivery analyses to detect trends, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities in operations.

Calculated and monitored Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as completion rate (+12% improvement), average delivery time, and peak slot utilization to measure service effectiveness.

Designed and built interactive Excel dashboards featuring pivot tables, dynamic charts, and slicers, enabling stakeholders to filter and explore performance metrics in real time.

Proposed route optimization strategies and schedule adjustments, resulting in an 18% increase in delivery efficiency through better resource allocation and reduced travel times.

Delivered actionable insights and recommendations that improved workflows, increased operational reliability, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

**Outcome:**

The analysis empowered the company to streamline delivery operations, reduce delays, and make informed scheduling decisions, resulting in higher on-time delivery rates, improved customer experience, and measurable efficiency gains.
